shim -- wedge this HTTP proxy between your browser and Tor 

Dependencies
-------------

You'll need Libevent 2 or greater!


How to Build and Install
-------------------------

1. Install Libevent 2 somewhere if it hasn't been already.
2. ./autogen.sh
3. ./configure
4. make
5. make install

Notes: 
* If you installed Libevent somewhere non-standard, you might need to export
PKG_CONFIG_PATH or LIBEVENT_CFLAGS and LIBEVENT_LIBS environment variables, and
then run ./configure again.

* If you're concerned about the proxy making direct connections (including
connections to HTTP servers and DNS servers), you can add the
--disable-direct-connections switch to configure. This will force you to
run shim with a SOCKS 4a server, returning an error message if one isn't
configured.

* If you're trying to debug a problem, and you're using GNU GCC, GDB etc,
you can:

	make clean
	make CFLAGS='-g -Wall'

... to prevent optimization that might interfere with your GDB sessions.


Command Line Arguments
-----------------------

shim [-l host] [-p port] [-qVv] [socks proxy]

-l
	The address to listen on, or "any" to listen on all available
	interfaces. The default listen address is 127.0.0.1

-p
	The port to listen on. Default is 8123.

-q
	Decrease verbosity. You can specify this option more than once.

-v
	Increase verbosity. You can specify this option more than once.

-V
	Print the version and exit.

socks proxy
	This is an optional argument specifying the SOCKS server to make
	connections through. SOCKS proxies are specified like this:

		socks_version://address[:port]

	Recognized SOCKS versions are socks4 and socks4a. With socks4, all
	host names are resolved through your name server, while with socks4a,
	host names are passed to your SOCKS server. The port is optional. By
	default it is set to 1080.

	To use shim with a typically-configured Tor:

		socks4a://127.0.0.1:9050

	If you built shim with --disable-direct-connections, you'll want
	socks4a!
